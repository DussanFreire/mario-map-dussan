# Help Mario üë®‚ö†‚Äº Save the princess üë∏

# Project Description
_Is a basic web application where you can build your own board which includes pipelines üèÅ, walls üü• and of course Mario üë®! The main objective of this application is to find the distance from each free
space on the board to all pipelines and to find the path from Mario's position to the closest pipeline in the board._

This web application has two basic interfaces:
1. Men√∫:
  <div style="text-align:center"><img src="https://github.com/joangerard/mario-map-dussan/blob/main/screenshots/menu.jpg" /></div>

2. Board:
* You can load our default board and have a fast view of the application:<div style="text-align:center"><img src="https://github.com/joangerard/mario-map-dussan/blob/main/screenshots/default_board.jpg" /></div>
* You can create your own board with the dimensions that you want and play with the application options üòâ: <div style="text-align:center"><img src="https://github.com/joangerard/mario-map-dussan/blob/main/screenshots/created_map.jpg" /></div>
* Don't trap Mario üòÇ:<div style="text-align:center"><img src="https://github.com/joangerard/mario-map-dussan/blob/main/screenshots/mario_trapped.jpg" /></div>
## Problem solver agent:
* **Formulation of the objective:** Mark the shortest distance from a pipeline in all the free spaces of the board, find the shortest path from Mario's position  
* **Problem formulation:** 
    * **Initial state:** The initial state is a board without any distances marked 
      * **Description of the actions:**
        * UP = Move up from the current position ‚¨Ü 
        * DOWN = Move down from the current position ‚¨á
        * LEFT = Move left from the current position ‚¨Ö
        * RIGHT = Move right from the current position ‚û°
    * **Transitional model:**
        * UP: move("up", state.row, state.col) ‚û° state: (row, col + 1)
        * DOWN: move("down", state.row, state.col) ‚û° state: (row, col - 1)
        * LEFT: move("left", state.row, state.col) ‚û° state: (row - 1, col)
        * RIGHT: move("right", state.row, state.col) ‚û° state: (row - 1, col)
    * **Target test:**
      * Finish all the posibles states (to have all the free spaces marked)
    * **Route cost:**
      * The route cost for echa action is 1
    * **State space:** :<div style="text-align:center"><img src="https://github.com/joangerard/mario-map-dussan/blob/main/screenshots/states_bfs.jpg" /></div>     
* **Search:**
    The search algorithm BFS was used in this project because, even though it uses more memory, its quantity of states is much
  lower than the quantity of states used in DFS. Foe example: <div style="text-align:center"><img src="https://github.com/joangerard/mario-map-dussan/blob/main/screenshots/states using dfs.jpg" /></div>
  This quantity doesn't seam to high when we compare it with the same example using BFS: <div style="text-align:center"><img src="https://github.com/joangerard/mario-map-dussan/blob/main/screenshots/states_bfs.jpg" /></div>
  But testing both with bigger boards the difference was about thousands of states
  
## Problem solver agent:
* **Algorithm used:** Once the board is already filled:
    * The pipelines positions are selected
    * The agent creates 4 posible successors(each successor comes from the chosen actiones) from each pipeline position
    * The possible successors that doesn't complete the following conditions are remove from the list üö´: 
        * The position must be inside the board
        * The position must be a free space
        * The successor can't be the parent from the current state
        * A free space that has already been marked can't be a successor
    * The distance is marked in the following way:
        * if the state is the root, then the successor distance marked in the free space is 1
        * if the state is also a free space, then the successor distance is the state distance + 1
