# Help Mario üë®‚ö†‚Äº Save the princess üë∏

# Project Description
_Is a basic web application where you can build your own board which includes pipelines üèÅ, walls üü• and of course Mario üë®! The main objective of this application is to find the distance from each free
space on the board to all pipelines, and the path from Mario's position to the closest pipeline in the board._

This web application has two basic interfaces:
1. Men√∫:
  <div style="text-align:center"><img src="https://github.com/joangerard/mario-map-dussan/blob/main/screenshots/menu.jpg" /></div>

2. Board:
* You can load a default board and have a fast view of the application:<div style="text-align:center"><img src="https://github.com/joangerard/mario-map-dussan/blob/main/screenshots/default_board.jpg" /></div>
* You can create your own board with the dimensions that you want and play with the application options üòâ: <div style="text-align:center"><img src="https://github.com/joangerard/mario-map-dussan/blob/main/screenshots/created_map.jpg" /></div>
* Don't trap Mario üòÇ:<div style="text-align:center"><img src="https://github.com/joangerard/mario-map-dussan/blob/main/screenshots/mario_trapped.jpg" /></div>
## Agent:
* **Formulation of the objective:** The objective is to mark the shortest distance from a pipeline in all the free spaces of the board, and find the shortest path from Mario's position
* **Problem formulation:** 
    * **Initial state:** The initial state is a board without any distances marked 
      * **Description of the actions:**
        * UP = Move up from the current position ‚¨Ü 
        * DOWN = Move down from the current position ‚¨á
        * LEFT = Move left from the current position ‚¨Ö
        * RIGHT = Move right from the current position ‚û°
    * **Transitional model:**
        * UP: move("up", state.row, state.col) ‚û° state: (row, col + 1)
        * DOWN: move("down", state.row, state.col) ‚û° state: (row, col - 1)
        * LEFT: move("left", state.row, state.col) ‚û° state: (row - 1, col)
        * RIGHT: move("right", state.row, state.col) ‚û° state: (row - 1, col)
    * **Target test:**
      * In this case we don't have a target because this prophecy is working with a normal agent. We could
      say that the target test would be to mark all the free spaces with the correct distance to the closest pipeline
    * **Route cost:**
      * The route cost for each action is 1
    * **State space:** :<div style="text-align:center"><img src="https://github.com/joangerard/mario-map-dussan/blob/main/screenshots/states_bfs.jpg" /></div>     
* **Search:**
    The search algorithm BFS was used in this project, even though it uses more memory, its quantity of states is much
  lower than the quantity of states used in DFS. For example: <div style="text-align:center"><img src="https://github.com/joangerard/mario-map-dussan/blob/main/screenshots/states using dfs.jpg" /></div>
  This quantity doesn't seam to high when we compare it with the same example using BFS: <div style="text-align:center"><img src="https://github.com/joangerard/mario-map-dussan/blob/main/screenshots/states_bfs.jpg" /></div>
  But testing both with bigger boards the difference was about hundreds of states
  
## Problem solver agent:
* **Algorithm used to mark all the distances:** 
    * All the pipelines positions are selected and saved in the queue from the bfs algorithm
    * An empty list was declared to save all the states or successors 
    * The loop begins       
        * The agent creates 4 possible successors(each successor comes from the chosen actions) from each pipeline position in the list
        * The possible successors that doesn't complete the following conditions are remove from the list üö´: 
            * The position must be inside the board
            * The position must be a free space
            * The successor can't be the parent from the current state
            * A free space that has already been marked can't be a successor
        * The distance is marked, on the successors, in the following way:
            * if the state is the root, then the successor distance marked in the free space is 1
            * if the state is also a free space, then the successor distance is the state distance + 1
        * The current state is added to the "states list"
        * All the successors al added to the queue
    * The length from the states list was returned
