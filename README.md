# Project Description
_Is a basic web application where you can build your own board which includes pipelines 🏁, walls 🟥 and of course Mario 👨! The main objective of this application is to find the distance from each free
space on the board to all pipelines, and the path from Mario's position to the closest pipeline in the board._

This web application has two basic interfaces:
1. Menú: 
 <p align="center">

   </p> 
2. Board:
* You can load a default board and have a fast view of the application:

   </p>


* You can create your own board with the dimensions that you want and play with the application options 😉:

## Agent:
* **Formulation of the objective:** The objective is to mark the shortest distance from a pipeline in all the free spaces of the board, and find the shortest path from Mario's position
* **Problem formulation:** 
    * **Initial state:** The initial state is a board without any distances marked 
      * **Description of the actions:**
        * UP = Move up from the current position ⬆ 
        * DOWN = Move down from the current position ⬇
        * LEFT = Move left from the current position ⬅
        * RIGHT = Move right from the current position ➡
    * **Transitional model:**
        * UP: move("up", state.row, state.col) -> state: (row, col + 1)
        * DOWN: move("down", state.row, state.col) -> state: (row, col - 1)
        * LEFT: move("left", state.row, state.col) -> state: (row - 1, col)
        * RIGHT: move("right", state.row, state.col) -> state: (row - 1, col)
    * **Target test:**
      * In this case we don't have a target because this prophecy is working with a normal agent. We could
      say that the target test would be to mark all the free spaces with the correct distance to the closest pipeline
    * **Route cost:**
      * The route cost for each action is 1
    * **State space:** :

   </p>
* **Search:**
    The search algorithm BFS was used in this project, even though it uses more memory, its quantity of states is much
  lower than the quantity of states used in DFS. For example in the following image we can see how the dfs algorithm 
  would mark all the free spaces on the board: 
  <p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/joangerard/mario-map-dussan/blob/main/screenshots/states using dfs.jpg" />
   </p>
  This quantity doesn't seam to high when we compare it with the same example using BFS:
  <p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/joangerard/mario-map-dussan/blob/main/screenshots/states_bfs.jpg" />
   </p>
  But when the algorithm dfs is used on a 11x11 board with a pipeline at the 
  position (6, 6), the program goes through 1043 states. 
    <p align="center">
<img src="https://github.com/joangerard/mario-map-dussan/blob/main/screenshots/dfs in a 11x11 board.jpg" />
   </p>
  In the other hand, when a bfs algorithm is used for the same problem the program only goes through 121 states.
      <p align="center">
<img src="https://github.com/joangerard/mario-map-dussan/blob/main/screenshots/bfs in a 11x11 board.jpg" />
   </p>
  That's the main reason why we rather use bfs for this program.
  
## Algorithms:
* **Algorithm used to mark all the distances:** 
  * Steps used:
    * All the pipelines positions were selected and saved in the queue from the bfs algorithm
    * An empty list was declared to save all the states or successors 
    * The loop begun       
        * One position from the queue was taken, and the agent created 4 possible successors for that position(each 
          successor comes from the chosen actions) 
        * The possible successors that weren't able to complete the following conditions were removed from the list of 
          possible successors 🚫: 
            * The position must be inside the board
            * The position must be a free space
            * The successor can't be the parent from the current state
            * A free space that has already been marked can't be a successor
        * The distance was marked, on the successors, in the following way:
            * if the state is the root, then the successor distance marked in the free space is 1
            * if the state is also a free space, then the successor distance is the state distance + 1
        * The current state was added to the "states list"
        * All the successors were added to the queue
    * At the end, of the process, the length from the states list was returned
* **Algorithm used to mark and select the best path from Mario's Position ✅:**
  * Steps used:
    * The process begun finding the initial step from Mario's position 
        * The agent created 4 possible successors(each successor comes from the chosen actions) from Mario's position
        * If one of the posible positions was a pipeline, the position was marked, and the process ended
        * If there wasn't a pipeline around Mario, then the initial state would be one of the possible options which follows 
          the next conditions:
            * Must be a free space
            * Its distance must be higher than 0
            * It's distance must ve the lower from the posible successors
            * If there is only free spaces with a distance 0 marked, then we can't select the initial state because Mario is trapped
    * The position of the initial step will be the current position from the first cicle of the next step
    * if the pipeline wasn't around Mario, then a similar process was used and repeated until the pipeline was found
